I want to develop a mobile app for osclass. I need a api server. But I did not find. 
I think osclass need a API server. So I built this project.

This is a  PHP REST API server for osclass. It is a very light-weight, easy to set up and get going. 
It is base on a very nice open source project, a rest server framework: jacwright/RestServer
https://github.com/jacwright/RestServer

Easy to set up.

1. Create named api(or other name) folder in osclass folder.
2. Copy all files to api folder.
3. Run.

Easy to use:

Examples:

1.Get category list, include all language.

  	http://www.your-osclass-site.com/api/v0.1/category or {hoemeurl}/api/v0.1/category
	
2.Get a category detail, category id = 9 

  	http://www.your-osclass-site.com/api/v0.1/category/9
	
3.Get all items list in category id = 9	

   	http://www.your-osclass-site.com/api/v0.1/category/9/items

4.Get item detail,item id = 1

 	http://www.your-osclass-site.com/api/v0.1/item/1

5.Get item resources,item id = 1

 	http://www.your-osclass-site.com/api/v0.1/item/1/images



Easy to develop:
The below code implements two query functions:
1 get all enable locale listurl: 
2 get locale detail, locale code = ??? 

Code:

```php

*  @url GET /locale
*  @url GET /locale/$code
 
public function getLocale($code){
	if ($code) {
	   $result = OSCLocale::newInstance()->findByCode($code);
	} else {
	   $result = OSCLocale::newInstance()->listAllEnabled();
	}
	return ($result);
}


```


The current version is only a start. Completed a few functional for most query.
Next, This API server, ARestAPI4OSClass, need a REST API Authorization & Authentication, and finish PUT, DELETE, etc. for EDIT or DELETE data.

I hope to get your help to complete these tasks. I also hope you can understand my bad English.
